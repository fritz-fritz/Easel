# ADR 0008: Easel Plasma wallpaper plugin as the OS host

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-07-19

## Context

Stock Plasma 6.4+ can host **day/night** wallpaper packages (`images` + `images_dark`)
via `org.kde.image` and KNightTime (system theme or sunrise/sunset). That covers
Appearance-keyed still sets (ADR 0007) but not dense solar/h24 schedules, live media, or
Easel-managed multi-display crops without keeping the desktop app’s still poller running.

Plasma’s intended extension point for richer wallpaper behavior is a **`Plasma/Wallpaper`
QML package** (`KPackageStructure: Plasma/Wallpaper`, root `WallpaperItem`). Community
plugins (zzag dynamic, video wallpaper plugins) already use this path. Stage 6 had already
named a Plasma QML plugin for live media; using the same host for dynamic stills gives
tighter OS integration while Easel’s Compose/Library GUI remains the management surface.

## Decision

1. **Ship an Easel wallpaper plugin** (`net.fritztech.easel.wallpaper`) installed under
   `~/.local/share/plasma/wallpapers/<id>/` (and system prefix when packaged). Plasma
   treats Easel as the active wallpaper engine per desktop/containment.
2. **Keep `easel-desktop` / `easel-cli` as the control plane.** The plugin renders and
   reacts; library, schedules, spanning layout, and import stay in the GUI/CLI. The plugin
   must not become a second settings UI beyond minimal Plasma wallpaper config (source
   path / “managed by Easel” status).
3. **Hosting matrix on Plasma (updated):**

   | Content | Preferred host | Fallback |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Appearance light/dark | Built-in day/night package **or** Easel plugin | Still poller via `org.kde.image` |
   | Dense solar / h24 | **Easel plugin** (schedule evaluation in-process or via daemon IPC) | Still poller; zzag only if user already uses it |
   | Live animated/video | **Easel plugin** (Stage 6) | Poster still |

4. **Apply path:** `PlasmaBackend` prefers setting `wallpaperPlugin` to the Easel plugin id
   when installed; otherwise retain ADR 0007 behavior (`org.kde.image` / zzag).
5. **Built-in day/night remains valuable** for users who want zero Easel process at idle for
   Appearance-only sets. The plugin does not replace that capability; it supersedes zzag as
   Easel’s preferred dense-solar host on Plasma.

## Consequences

- Scaffold lives at `apps/easel-plasma-wallpaper/` (KPackage + QML); desktop packaging
  installs it beside the app.
- Detection joins `plasma_dynamic_plugin_id()` / a new `easel_plasma_plugin_id()` probe.
- IPC contract (file watch, local socket, or D-Bus) between desktop automation and the
  plugin is required before dense solar can leave the still poller — tracked as Stage 6
  work started from this ADR.
- Docs must say: stock Plasma day/night ≠ Apple Dynamic Desktop; Easel plugin ≈ portable
  schedule host under Plasma’s wallpaper API.
